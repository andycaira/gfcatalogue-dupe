The catalogue raisonné of Griffin Fisher includes all of the known paintings, sculptures, prints, and other works created by the artist. 

The artworks in this catalogue are organized chronologically.  Each artwork has been assigned a catalogue number based on its year of production.  Each object type is classified by general medium before assigning it a number. Read more about the methodology [here](https://andycaira.github.io/gfcatalogue-dupe/method)

Each artwork has its own page, or record, which includes the work's principal information and, when possible, an image that can be enlarged. Many entries include commentaries and supplementary materials, such as related drawings by Fisher, documentary photographs, reference images, and other relevant information.
